# Excel Integration Summary

## Problem

The agent needed to be updated to properly use the Excel file with the specific requirements:

- Sheet name: "GenAI Security Audit Sheet"
- Column names: "Sub Question" and "Baseline Evidence " (with space)
- Proper workflow: Ask subquestions, record observations, present baseline evidence, evaluate conformity

## Solution

Updated the agent to properly integrate with the Excel file and implement the correct audit workflow.

### Changes Made:

1. **Updated Excel Loading** (`agent_skeleton/agent/multi_tool_agent/tool.py`):

   - Modified `load_audit_data()` to read the specific sheet "GenAI Security Audit Sheet"
   - Updated to use correct column names: "Sub Question" and "Baseline Evidence "
   - Added proper error handling for Excel file reading

2. **Simplified Question Structure**:

   - Removed complex grouping by main questions
   - Now directly processes sub-questions from the Excel file
   - Each row with a "Sub Question" becomes a separate audit question

3. **Updated Audit Workflow**:

   - **Category Selection**: User selects one of 7 NIST AI RMF categories
   - **Sub-Question Process**: Agent asks sub-questions from Excel file
   - **Observation Recording**: User's answers are recorded as observations
   - **Baseline Evidence**: Agent presents baseline evidence requirements from Excel
   - **Evidence Evaluation**: User provides evidence, agent evaluates conformity
   - **Progress Tracking**: Moves through all sub-questions for the category

4. **Enhanced Agent Configuration** (`agent_skeleton/agent/multi_tool_agent/agent.py`):

   - Restored full audit tool functionality
   - Updated instructions to match the workflow requirements
   - Proper tool function integration

5. **Updated Module Exports** (`agent_skeleton/agent/multi_tool_agent/__init__.py`):
   - Exported all necessary functions for ADK integration
   - Proper function availability for agent loading

### Excel File Structure Used:

- **Sheet Name**: "GenAI Security Audit Sheet"
- **Key Columns**:
  - "Trust-worthiness characteristic" - Category filtering
  - "Sub Question" - Questions to ask users
  - "Baseline Evidence " - Evidence requirements (note the trailing space)
  - "NIST AI RMF Control" - Control information
  - "Question ID" - Question identification

### Audit Workflow Implementation:

1. **Category Selection**:

   ```
   User: "I want to audit Privacy-Enhanced"
   Agent: Starts session, presents first sub-question
   ```

2. **Sub-Question Process**:

   ```
   Agent: "Has a Privacy/DPIA been conducted for all GenAI systems?"
   User: "Yes, we have conducted DPIAs for all systems"
   Agent: Records observation, presents baseline evidence
   ```

3. **Evidence Submission**:

   ```
   Agent: "Baseline Evidence: Privacy Impact Assessment documentation..."
   User: "Here is our DPIA documentation..."
   Agent: Evaluates conformity (Full/Partial/No)
   ```

4. **Progress Tracking**:
   - Moves through all sub-questions for the category
   - Tracks progress: current/total questions
   - Provides completion summary

### Conformity Evaluation Logic:

- **Full Conformity**: Strong evidence match with key audit terms
- **Partial Conformity**: Some evidence provided but incomplete
- **No Conformity**: Insufficient or missing evidence

### Files Modified:

- `agent_skeleton/agent/multi_tool_agent/tool.py` - Core audit logic
- `agent_skeleton/agent/multi_tool_agent/agent.py` - Agent configuration
- `agent_skeleton/agent/multi_tool_agent/__init__.py` - Module exports

### Files Created:

- `test_excel_loading.py` - Test script for Excel integration
- `check_sheet.py` - Excel file structure verification

## Testing Results:

✅ Excel file loads successfully (234 rows, 9 columns)
✅ All 7 NIST AI RMF categories identified
✅ Session creation works (42 sub-questions for Privacy-Enhanced)
✅ Proper column names and sheet name integration

## Next Steps:

1. **Restart services**: `cd agent_skeleton && docker compose up --build`
2. **Test the audit workflow**: Select categories and go through sub-questions
3. **Verify evidence evaluation**: Test conformity assessment functionality

## Expected Result:

The audit agent now properly uses the Excel file with the correct sheet name and column names, implementing the full audit workflow as specified.
