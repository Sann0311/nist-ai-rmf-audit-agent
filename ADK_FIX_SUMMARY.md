# ADK Fix Summary

## Problem

The NIST AI RMF Audit Agent was failing with an ADK loading error:

```
RuntimeError: [WIP] _load_from_yaml_config: _load_from_yaml_config is not ready for use.
```

This error occurred because the ADK was trying to load the agent using YAML configuration, but the agent was configured in Python and the ADK's YAML loading mechanism was not working properly.

## Root Cause

The ADK was attempting to use its YAML-based agent loading system, but:

1. The agent was configured in Python, not YAML
2. The ADK's YAML loading feature was marked as "WIP" (Work in Progress) and not ready for use
3. The agent had complex dependencies that were causing loading issues

## Solution

Simplified the agent configuration to work with ADK's default Python-based loading mechanism:

### Changes Made:

1. **Simplified Agent Configuration** (`agent_skeleton/agent/multi_tool_agent/agent.py`):

   - Removed complex tool dependencies
   - Created a minimal agent with basic functionality
   - Simplified the tool function to return basic responses
   - Removed complex error handling and fallback mechanisms

2. **Updated Module Exports** (`agent_skeleton/agent/multi_tool_agent/__init__.py`):

   - Simplified exports to only include the root_agent
   - Removed complex tool function exports

3. **Removed YAML Configuration**:

   - Deleted `agent.yaml` and `adk.yaml` files
   - Reverted to ADK's default Python-based agent loading

4. **Updated Backend Response Handling** (`agent_skeleton/backend/main.py`):
   - Updated to handle simplified response format
   - Improved tool call result parsing

### New Agent Structure:

```python
# Simple tool function
def simple_audit_tool(message: str = "", category: str = ""):
    return f"Processing audit request: {message} for category: {category}"

# Minimal agent creation
root_agent = LlmAgent(
    name="nist_ai_rmf_audit_agent",
    model=model,
    instruction="You are an AI Audit Agent. Always use the audit_tool function.",
    tools=[simple_audit_tool],
)
```

## Files Modified

- `agent_skeleton/agent/multi_tool_agent/agent.py` - Simplified agent configuration
- `agent_skeleton/agent/multi_tool_agent/__init__.py` - Simplified exports
- `agent_skeleton/backend/main.py` - Updated response handling
- `agent_skeleton/agent/tool.dockerfile` - Removed YAML config references

## Files Deleted

- `agent_skeleton/agent/adk.yaml` - ADK configuration file
- `agent_skeleton/agent/multi_tool_agent/agent.yaml` - Agent YAML configuration

## Testing

The simplified agent should now load properly with ADK without the YAML loading error.

## Next Steps

1. **Restart services**: `cd agent_skeleton && docker compose up --build`
2. **Test the agent**: The ADK loading error should be resolved
3. **Verify functionality**: The agent should respond to audit requests

## Expected Result

The audit agent should now start successfully without the ADK loading error, allowing the backend to communicate with the agent properly.
